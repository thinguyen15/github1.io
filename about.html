<h4>Honda Accord euro-R CL1</h4>
<p>This is my latest car. I found the ad on Nettiauto and knew I had to test drive it right away. After a couple of days of careful consideration, I decided to buy it - and it turned out to be one of the best choices I've ever made. </p> 

<p>This was one of my recent project, wrapping this car. As a car wrap designer, I wanted to create something that truly stands out. I was inspired by Japanese-style art, so I combined four different styles: drawing, silk art, canvas, and brush painting.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Year: 2000</li>
    <li>Top speed: 243 km/h</li>
    <li>Acceleration 0-100 km/h: 6,7s</li>
    <li>Horsepower: 220 hp</li>
    <li>Fuel: Petrol</li>
    <li>Fuel consumption: 11,6/100km</li>
    <li>Engine displacement: 2,2l</li>
    <li>Transmission: Five speed manual</li>
</ul>

<h5>Honda Accord SIR-T CF4</h5>
<p>Honda Accord SIR-T CF4 is my first JDM (Japanese Domestic Marketing) car. This car is one of the cleanest examples I've seen. It's responsive, lightweight, and the VTEC crossover is addictive every time.</p>
<p>The CF4 Accord boasts a captivating design characterized by the clean lines and straightforward aesthetics, typical of the late '90s. It's a well proportioned sedan with minimalistic, yet refined features. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Year: 1997</li>
    <li>Top speed: 243 km/h</li>
    <li>Acceleration 0-100 km/h: 6,8s</li>
    <li>Horsepower: 200 hp </li>
    <li>Fuel: Petrol</li>
    <li>Fuel consumption: 11,6/100km</li>
    <li>Engine displacement: 2.0l</li>
    <li>Transmission: Five speed manual</li>
</ul>

<h5>Toyota MR2 SW20</h5>
<p>MR2 was my fifth car. The one feature that got my attention was a pop-up headlights! And was equipt with 3S-GTE engine made by Yamaha. The white color and t-top gave the 80.s "Miami Vice" Testarossa vibe. </p>

<p>The MR2—named by Toyota as an acronym for "Midship Runabout for Two" was, from the very start, one of the most unconventional cars ever produced by the Japanese automotive giant. Its mid-engine layout, typically reserved for high-end, focused sports cars, was something entirely unique in an affordable and reliable package. This wasn't just unusual among Japanese manufacturers, but in the car market as a whole—only Pontiac's Fiero offered a remotely similar concept.<p> 
<p>Suddenly, the experience of having an engine roaring just behind your seat was no longer exclusive to those who could afford a Ferrari Testarossa or a Lamborghini Countach. The MR2 brought that thrill within reach.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Year: 1992</li>
    <li>Top speed: 245 km/h</li>
    <li>Acceleration 0-100 km/h: 5,5s</li>
    <li>Horsepower: 240 hp </li>
    <li>Fuel: Petrol</li>
    <li>Fuel consumption: 12.0l/100km</li>
    <li>Engine displacement: 2.0l</li>
    <li>Transmission: Five speed manual</li>
</ul>

<h5>Toyota Crown Majesta UZS-186
<p>The Toyota Crown was my first luxury car, and it's completly different car than my other cars I owned. The smoothness of air suspension and V8 make cruising around the city an absolute pleasure. It was made to transport high value people.  </p>
<p>The fourth-generation Crown Majesta was placed on the market in July 2004. Using the 12th-generation Crown that came out in December 2003 ...commonly known as the "Zero Crown" as the base model, the Majesta added its own front and rear body design, interior accessories, and engine variations. The large front grille, projector-type headlamps, and vertical rear combination lamps were among its characteristic exterior features. While its wheelbase was the same as that of the Crown at 2,850 mm (50 mm larger than the previous generation), the Majesta's length and width were larger by 135 mm and 15 mm, respectively, than those of the Crown. The Crown badge on the front grille was replaced with the Toyota emblem</p>
<p>The V8 DOHC 4.3-liter engine (3UZ-FE) was shared with the Celsior and the Soarer. The transmission was a 6-speed automatic (6 Super ECT). Either a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive (FR) or an i-Four 4-wheel-drive configuration could be chosen. The FR model offered a radar cruise control for automatically adjusting the distance from the car in front by means of a laser radar system when driving at speeds below 30 km/h.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Year: 2006</li>
    <li>Top speed: 250 km/h</li>
    <li>Acceleration 0-100 km/h: 6,7s</li>
    <li>Horsepower: 310 hp </li>
    <li>Fuel: Petrol</li>
    <li>Fuel consumption: 12.0l/100km</li>
    <li>Engine displacement: 4.3l</li>
    <li>Transmission: Automatic</li>
</ul>
